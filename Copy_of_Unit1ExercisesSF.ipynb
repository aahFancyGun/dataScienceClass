        "All three variable types can be iterated through in similar ways. A string is simply an array or list of chars which allows it to be iterated through in many of the same ways. A dictionary can also be iterated through similarly to a list but with the additional consideration of a key. How they differ though, is what they store and how they store it. A string as discussed before is just an array of chars and so a char is the only var type it can store. A list can store any variable type in any entry. Finally, a dictionary functions similarly to a hashmap in java in which a key is provided that corresponds to a specific value. I.e. if my key is \"cheese\": 32 where the dictionary is named cheeseStorer you might access 32 via cheeseStorer[\"cheese\"]."

One of the first reasons we might use a numpy array is because the numpy library treats floats with more care compared to the normally defined float variable of vanilla python. Additionally, while python boasts very few math functions, numpy is able to add on an incredible amount. Python's only mathematical functions more or less only consist of abs() but numpy adds on exponents, logarithms, and trigonometric methods to name a few."

Pandas dataframes can not only be created from numpy arrays but also from a variety of file types. Json, jsonl, and csv to name a few, all of which have very important real world applications. Because of this, there are many scenarios where we might want to use a dataframe over a numpy array. For example, because pandas offers a very useful query function, its possible to skip over iterating and searching through every element in a dataframe via for loop."
